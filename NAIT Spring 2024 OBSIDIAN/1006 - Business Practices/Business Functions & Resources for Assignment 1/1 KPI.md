# Creating a set of KPIs
Checkout Sales Teller Example:
## What is your desired outcome?
 - Achieve an accurate, efficient, and pleasant checkout process for the employee

## Why does this outcome matter?
- Competitors that achieve a better process are more likely to retain customers
- Profit losses are expected with inaccurate checkouts
- Inefficiency may result in loss of customers
- Effective outcomes for this KPI can be used for marketing the brand and future expansions

How can you influence this outcome?
- Newly hired tellers will complete a training and assessment cycle to support their alignment with the culture and processes of the position
- A need to reinforce business rules or expectations will triffer additional training by the supervisor
- Annual audits on the KPI may trigger employee shadowing or additional department training

## Who is responsible for the business outcome?
- The teller supervisor is responsible for tracking and reporting the performance of their subordinates to the Sales Manager
- The Sales Manager will review summary statistics and outliers with the supervisor 
- Recommendations will be made by the Sales Manager with the input from the supervisor on a monthly basis

## How will you know you've achieved your outcome?
- Accurate checkout processes can be tracked through batch out calculations point of sales (POS) system audits
- Pleasant experiences are tracked through incentivized customer surveys distributed through the purchase receipts. Positive responses should be above 80% for each unique teller ID
- Efficient processes are tracked through the completion of the review rubric on a monthly basis

## KPIs that can be derived from this analysis:
- Tellers will engage in supportive communication to achieve a customer response of 80% or higher on their monthly audits. If this KPI is unmet, the employee will be scheduled for colleague observations
- Teller will maintain an average checkout processing time of 4 minutes, tracked daily through the point of sales (POS) system. If this KPI is unmet, the teller or department will undergo process review and training. 

# Creating KPIs Example
- Functional Area - Purchasing
- Position - Supply Chain Director
- Metric - Fill Rate
- Frequency - Monthly
- Measurement - 95%
- KPI:
	- The supply chain director will review fill rates every month to ensure that suppliers are providing 95% on all orders
- KPI + Intervention
	- The Supply chain director will review fill rates every month to ensure that suppliers are providing 95% fulfillment on all orders. *IF this KPI is not met*, the supervisor will impose negotiations with noted suppliers.
