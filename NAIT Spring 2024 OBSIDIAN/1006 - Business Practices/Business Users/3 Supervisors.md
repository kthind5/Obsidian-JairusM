- Usually rise from the ranks of the organization
- “Out of touch” with the details of the operations
- Tend to be interested in budgetary considerations and efficiency of their operations
- Need daily, detailed, historical information about activities
- Need information that identifies specific operational problems; summarizes operational activities

# Examples
