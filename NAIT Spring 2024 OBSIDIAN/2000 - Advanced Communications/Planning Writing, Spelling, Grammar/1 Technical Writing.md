# What do Do 
- Focus on information that needs to be communicated to explain the subject matter
- Where applicable, includes the options to be considered, and the decisions that need to be made
- Addresses the reader's desire for ***RELEVANT*** information
- Strive for conciseness and specificity; say as much as you can with as few words as possible

# What not to Do
- Do not leave anything to the reader's interpretation
- Be firm and decisive, explain clearly your stance and points
- Do not include emotions and feelings, again this is objective (use logic, facts, and reason)
- Do not be funny :(
