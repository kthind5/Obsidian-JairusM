**AI: The Fine Line Between Creativity and Piracy**

# Thoughts & Ideas
- Kendrick vs Drake beef: Drake being sued for the AI Tupac diss track
- AI memes using artists voices
- Fully released AI albums; the Travis Scott album I saw that one time released on Youtube [here](https://youtu.be/Nr5La2ZDoEI?si=S5wEPyoudJYXXeOt)
- Are these things being monetized? And if so, where is the line drawn for creative use, and unauthorized usage?
- What are the current copyright laws with AI created music using other artists likeness?
	- Also maybe a good base would be researching the current music copyright laws and comparing and contrasting with the depth that the law goes into AI music
