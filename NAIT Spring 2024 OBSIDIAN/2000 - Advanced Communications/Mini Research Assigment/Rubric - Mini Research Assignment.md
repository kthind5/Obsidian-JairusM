>[!Info] Choose a topic of interest to you; perhaps a current event or something you heard about before. What do you want to know about it? What question do you want to be answered? Where are you going to find information? 
>
>Write your paper so that it explores the question. (It would be a good idea to include the question within the start of your paper.) Tell us more about the issue or concern. What do people say about it? Make sure you use quality sources. The goal of this paper is to explore and understand the context of your problem so you are able to research solutions later in the course.

# Information
1.      Formal research starts with an inquiry (research question). The researcher then conducts a literature review to explore the work of others who have attempted answering the same question. The materials that are examined and how conclusions are drawn can dramatically impact the authenticity of the research and its findings. Conducting research that is either incomplete or biased can impact one’s professional credibility, if not career.

2.      For this assignment, pay attention to detail (**answering the actual research question**), substantiate your statements (**the quality of the sources you have used**), and offer your logical conclusions about the context of the problem you wish to research(**solid writing mechanics and arguments**).

3.      This paper is more about performing the research to find high quality, supportive references for your topic. We want to ensure that you clearly understand your problem and its context, and that there is a sufficient amount of available material to address it. The goal of the paper is to use quality writing to demonstrate sufficient research to answer and/or support your research question.

# Process
1.      First, think of your topic and come up with a “research” question; this is the question that will guide your research efforts. This will motivate you to conduct authentic research. The research question can be anything, provided a well-written response is appropriate to length of the paper (*keep it fairly narrow – 2 pages is NOT a lot!*)

2.      Start your research – use the NAIT library, use keywords, adjust, follow leads to different sources, use different databases or Google Scholar, etc. TAKE NOTES!

3.      Examine sources that directly address the question, and determine if they are credible.

4.      Write a 2 page paper (font 12, APA citations, 1.5-spaced). 

Reminders:
a.       Use headings to organize your sections (see example)

b.      **Do not use bullets or lists**; write in complete sentences

c.       Cite a minimum of 3 credible sources in your paper from the NAIT library or from a source like Google Scholar. Credible also means the information provided clearly relates to your position / research question.

d.      Include correct APA reference entries on the last page (References page), which correspond with your in-text citations. *Double-check all sources have an in-text citation AND a reference entry (not one or the other alone)*

e.       Revise and edit for grammar – errors draw the reader’s attention away from the content, which is not what you want.

f.        Submit your paper to Moodle by the deadline in Microsoft Word format (no other file type will be accepted)

g.      **Do not rush**. Remember, most of an academic writer’s time is spent finding useful information. You will have an easier time writing if you have done thorough research.
