- Order Property can only be applied to flex items.
- This property lets us change the layout order of flex items <span style="background:#d4b106">without changing the HTML</span>
- The order value is defined  by a whole single number.
	- By default, all flex items have an order value of 0
- If all flex items have the same order value, they will appear in the same order that they appear in the HTML
- Assigning different order value will lay out items from lowest to highest number
- Negative numbers can be used
