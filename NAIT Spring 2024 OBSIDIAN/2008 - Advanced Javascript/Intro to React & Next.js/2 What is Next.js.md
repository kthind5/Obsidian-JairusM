# What is Next.js?
It is a framework that uses `React.js` at its core.

## Added Benefits
- Server Side and other rendering techniques (such as Pre-rendering/Static Site Generation and Deferred Rendering/Incremental Static Regeneration)
- Automatic Code Splitting
	- Splits JS and CSS 
- Hot Module Replacement
	- This gives an environment for devs that when you make a change in your code it is immediately reflected on your environment
- This framework allows you to get React projects setup more quickly in general rather than just using React.js without next.
