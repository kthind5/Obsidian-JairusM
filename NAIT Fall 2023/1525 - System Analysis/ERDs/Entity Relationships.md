## How to Determine Relationship Between two Entities

# Definitions and Examples
- **Zero or One Relationship:** Imagine a situation where a student may or may not be enrolled in a course. It's possible for a student to have no course or only one course at a time. So, it's a "zero or one" relationship between a student and a course.
    
- **One Relationship:** This refers to a situation where there is a mandatory connection between entities. For instance, a student must belong to at least one course. Each student has exactly one course they are enrolled in.
    
- **One and Only One Relationship:** In this scenario, it's strict: a student can be enrolled in only one course at any given time, and it's mandatory for the student to be in one course.
    
- **Zero or Many Relationship:** Consider a situation where a course can have no student enrolled, or it can have multiple students. There's no restriction on the number of students enrolled in a courseâ€”it could be zero, one, or many.
    
- **One or Many Relationship:** Here, every student must be enrolled in at least one course, but they can be in multiple courses simultaneously. So, each student is in at least one course, but they could be in many.
    
- **Many Relationship:** This refers to a scenario where many students can be enrolled in many courses. There's no restriction on the number of students or courses involved; it's a many-to-many relationship where multiple students can be enrolled in multiple courses.
