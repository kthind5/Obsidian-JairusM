- [x] Write quick business case in word doc
>My business case is for a personal training business. It is called Jimmyâ€™s Personal Training. Clients will have the opportunity to book personal training sessions with many Personal Trainers. They will have the option to book sessions ranging from 60, 90, to 120 minutes per session, with a rate of $75/hour. Clients can only book one session at a time, and the next session can be booked after the latest session is finished. Each client can request to do the session at their own home, or at the gym. However, not all personal trainers are available for home sessions.
## Screen Walkthrough
- [x] Do a quick screen walkthrough explaining how it works

### Chosen Elements of Screen Design
- [x]  Groupings:
> I used groupings in the sense where I grouped fields together that related to one another. As seen in screen 2, in the Client Information section, there are four groupings: Name, Address, Contact Info, and Notes for Trainer. This makes the page easier to navigate, and less overwhelming to look at. 

- [x]  Font Choice
> For the overall font choice, I chose to use *Inter*, which is part of the Sans Serif font family. I chose this because it is a clean, simplistic font, making it not too difficult to read 

- [x] Text Size
> To keep text size consistent, I used only size 18, 24, and 40. Size 18 is for content that isn't the main focus. As shown in both screen 1 and screen 2, the ClientID is in size 18. Size 24 is for general content, while size 40 is for titles of sections. The only part I failed with the font size would be the table on screen 1, which is slightly smaller than 18. 
 
- [x] Color
> For color I simply chose black text on white background. This way there wouldn't be too much going on for the user to get overwhelmed. The header that the top of all screens is a faded green colour. This colour was chosen so that it would clearly contrast the black and white, but would not be too overbearing visually. 

- [x]  Balance
> I tried my best to have all screens have balance. In the first screen there are only 2 clear sections, which are almost similar in height and length, allowing for balance. On the second screen the contact info is nicely separated into four even sections, with the invoice at the bottom equaling all four boxes on the top combined. 

- [x] Symmetry
> Similarly with balance, I tried to keep sections on the screens as symmetrical as possible. In screen one, there is clearly a line of symmetry separating the top and bottom sections. In screen two the client information sections also has symmetrical sections. The third page would be the most unsymmetrical, but there is a clear distinction between top and bottom. 

- [x]  Unity
> To keep things visually coherent, sections are grouped in the same size, with the same distance apart from one another. This is most seen in screen 2, where the four main sections on the top are equally spaced out, while also being the same size.

- [x] Predictability
 >I tried to keep the content on all screens as linear as possible, meaning that the user should be able to navigate the screens mostly reading top-down. 
 
- [x] Simplicity
> I kept things simple by ensuring that boxes and texts have the same end point. If a group of text is longer, the start point may be different, but the end point is the same. This is shown with the text in the "Name" section in *Client Information*

- [x] Proportion
> 	Everything is proportionate within the individual screens. Things that need to be of focus, like the invoice section in screen 2, are clearly bigger and more focused than others.
