# Pitch A Business Case
Come up with unique business case and pitch it to Tim

`My business case idea is for a personal training business. I was thinking if calling it Jimmy’s Personal Training. Clients will have the opportunity to ask for  personal training sessions from many different trainers. They will have the option for choosing to go to the gyms location, or have a personal trainer come to their homes to train them. Sessions will range from 60 to 120 minutes.`
