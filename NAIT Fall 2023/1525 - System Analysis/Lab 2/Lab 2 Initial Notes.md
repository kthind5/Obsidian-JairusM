# Due: TBD
# Initial Questions & Notes
- Pull up the session to find the details
- Things can change from what is booked, and also what is done - this means the payment information needs to be able to be updated (generation of invoice)
-

~~- Have a screen that you can pick the client who wants to pay, then go to the other screen based on customer choice and actions~~

- Need list of services
