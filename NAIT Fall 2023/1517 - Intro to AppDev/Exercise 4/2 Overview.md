You are to create an additional project within the `TrainWatchSolution` web application solution. This project will be a .Net Core 7 class library. The library will contain Entity, DAL, and BLL classes. You will configure your web application to use the class library via dependency injection. You will create a new component(s) to test that will display a tabular report using data returned from a class library service.

**Use the demos presented in class as a guide to implementing this exercise.**
