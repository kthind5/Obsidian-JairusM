1. Right click on the folder that your Blazor page is in. 
2. Click add and add a class. 
3. Name it the same as your file but then add a cs 
4. It will highlight the class definition as an error. You will need to add the word partial to the class definition before the word class. 
5. Copy and paste all of your `@code` from the original file.
