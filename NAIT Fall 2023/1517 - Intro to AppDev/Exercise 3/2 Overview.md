You are to create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application (Blazor Pages) for this exercise. Create the application using Visual Studio 2022 .Net Core 7. Name your wep app project **`TrainWebApp`**. Name your solution **`TrainWatchSolution`**. Place your work in your exercise repository.

To ensure that your web application works, build and run your project. A browser window should open in a local hosted port.(Example [https://localhost:5001](https://localhost:5001/) , your port may be different).

The styling for your application is up to you. The template for the `web app` project has Bootstrap built in, but you can use any website styling you choose.
