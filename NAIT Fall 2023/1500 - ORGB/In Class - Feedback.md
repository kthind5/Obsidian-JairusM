# What is Feedback

## Feedback Reflection
1.
- work performance review
- a poor combination of constructive and positive
- Confused and unsure of what to do at times

2.
- They were uncertain because they were confused
- They found the feedback somewhat helpful, but it was challenging for them to absorb the information due to lack of connection with the other dude.
- I don't think it changed his perspective because he was just confused
